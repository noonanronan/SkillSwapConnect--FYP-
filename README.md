## Project Requirements
This project showcases the integration of advanced software development techniques and research methodologies to address a challenging computing problem. The solution involves a cohesive blend of technologies, including Angular, Firebase, Apache Kafka, and real-time web sockets, aiming to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of digital education through peer-to-peer learning platforms. The dissertation critically evaluates the project's implementation, highlighting its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for future improvement. 

## Application Architecture
Skill Swap Connect utilizes a microservices architecture with a frontend built using Angular and Ionic for a responsive, cross-platform user experience. The backend, powered by Firebase, handles user authentication and data storage, ensuring real-time synchronization across user sessions. Apache Kafka is integrated to manage real-time messaging, crucial for the chat functionality, acting as a robust message broker among services. The system ensures data flows efficiently from the user interactions on the frontend, processed via backend logic, and updates are pushed back in real-time, maintaining a consistent and dynamic user experience.
